# Study Guide: The Nervous System

## Introduction
The nervous system is like the control center of our body. It helps us think, solve problems, learn new things, and control our body movements. Without it, we wouldn't be able to do any of the amazing things we do every day!

## Main Parts of the Nervous System

### 1. Brain
The brain is a soft organ inside our skull that acts as the main control center of our body.

**Three Main Parts of the Brain:**

**Cerebrum (say suh-REE-brum)**
- The **largest** part of the brain
- Functions:
  - Helps us **remember** things (memory)
  - Controls our **thinking** and helps in problem-solving
  - Controls the **sense organs**

**Cerebellum (say suh-REE-BELL-um)**
- **Smaller** than the cerebrum
- Functions:
  - Controls **voluntary muscles** in our body
  - Helps us **balance** our body during activities like walking and cycling

**Medulla**
- **Connects** the brain to the spinal cord
- Function:
  - Controls **involuntary muscles** in our body
  - Controls functions that happen without our thinking like breathing, blood circulation, and digestion

### 2. Spinal Cord
- A **tube-like structure** that starts from the medulla and ends at the lower end of the backbone
- Protected by the **vertebral column** (backbone)
- Transfers messages between the brain and the rest of the body

### 3. Nerves
Nerves are like wires that carry messages between the brain and other parts of the body.

**Three Types of Nerves:**

**Sensory Nerves**
- Present between sense organs and the brain
- Carry messages from eyes, ears, tongue, skin, and nose to your brain
- Help you see, hear, taste, feel, and smell things

**Motor Nerves**
- Present between the brain and different muscles
- Carry messages from brain to muscles
- Help you do movements like writing, holding objects, turning pages

**Mixed Nerves**
- Sometimes work as sensory nerves, sometimes as motor nerves
- Example: Nerve between brain and thigh - senses pain AND helps you bend/straighten your leg

## Reflex Actions
- **Quick and automatic responses** to a stimulus
- Example: Moving your hand away when you touch a hot pan
- Controlled by the **spinal cord**, not the brain
- Happen **without our control**

**Steps of Reflex Action:**
1. Skin feels the hot pan
2. Sensory nerves send message to spinal cord
3. Spinal cord passes message to motor nerves
4. Motor nerves carry message to arm muscles
5. Muscles contract and hand moves away

## Sense Organs
Our body has **five sense organs** that help us connect with our surroundings:

### 1. Eyes
**Parts of the Eye:**
- **Cornea**: Thin, transparent area covering the front of the eye
- **Iris**: Round, colored part that gives the eye its color
- **Pupil**: Opening at the center of the iris where light enters
- **Lens**: Located behind iris, helps focus light onto retina
- **Retina**: Light-sensitive layer where the image is formed
- **Optic nerve**: Connects eye to brain and carries messages

### 2. Ears
**Three Parts of the Ear:**
- **Outer ear (Pinna)**: Visible part that receives sounds and passes them through ear canal
- **Middle ear**: Contains three bones that receive sounds from eardrum
- **Inner ear**: Converts sounds into nerve signals sent to brain
- **Eardrum**: Thin membrane that vibrates when receiving sounds

### 3. Nose
- Has two openings called **nostrils**
- Nostrils are lined with **hair and mucus** that trap dirt
- **Nasal cavity** has cells that detect smells
- Helps us both **smell and breathe**

### 4. Tongue
- Surface has many **taste buds**
- Taste buds detect different tastes: **sweet, sour, bitter, and salty**
- Send signals to brain through nerves

### 5. Skin
- The **largest organ** in our body
- Covers the entire body
- Helps us feel **heat, cold, pressure, and pain**
- Nerves under skin's surface collect information and send to brain

## Connection with Other Systems
The nervous system works closely with the skeletal and muscular systems:
1. **Eyes see** the object (sensory nerves to brain)
2. **Brain understands** what needs to be done
3. **Brain sends message** to muscles (through motor nerves)
4. **Muscles contract and relax** to move bones and perform the action

## Key Terms to Remember
- **Stimulus**: Something that makes a living being react or respond
- **Voluntary muscles**: Muscles we can control
- **Involuntary muscles**: Muscles that work automatically
- **Socket**: A hollow structure (like eye socket)
- **Vibrates**: To quickly move back and forth

## Study Tips
1. Remember the three main parts: Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves
2. Know the three parts of the brain and their functions
3. Understand the difference between sensory, motor, and mixed nerves
4. Practice identifying the five sense organs and their parts
5. Remember that reflex actions are controlled by the spinal cord, not the brain

## Fun Facts
- A newborn baby's brain weighs about 400 grams, but an adult brain weighs about 1.4 kg!
- The brain uses about 20% of the body's total energy
- Your skin is the largest organ in your body
- The optic nerve contains about 1 million nerve fibers
