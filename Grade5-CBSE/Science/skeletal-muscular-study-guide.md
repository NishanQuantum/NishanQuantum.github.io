# Study Guide: The Skeletal and Muscular Systems

## Introduction
We can walk, run, dance, jump, and do many activities because of the skeletal and muscular systems in our body. These two systems work together like teammates to help us move and stay strong!

## Skeletal System

### What is the Skeletal System?
The skeletal system is a strong **framework of bones** that gives our body structure and support. It's like the frame of a house that keeps everything in place!

### Parts of the Skeletal System

#### 1. Skull
**Structure:**
- Made up of **22 bones**
- Rests on our neck
- Only the **lower jaw bone** can move
- All other bones are **fixed** (cannot move)

**Functions:**
- **Protects our brain** (internal organ)
- Lower jaw helps us **speak and chew food**

#### 2. Backbone (Spine)
**Structure:**
- Made up of **33 small bones** called **vertebrae**
- Each bone is called a **vertebra**
- Forms a strong column called **vertebral column**

**Functions:**
- Helps us **stand straight, sit upright, bend, and twist**
- **Protects the spinal cord** (part of nervous system)

#### 3. Ribcage
**Structure:**
- Made up of **12 pairs of ribs**
- Each rib is thin and curved
- Connected to **sternum** (flat bone) in front
- Connected to **backbone** at the back
- Last **two pairs are floating ribs** (attached only to backbone)

**Functions:**
- **Protects internal organs** like heart and lungs
- **Moves up and down** when we breathe

#### 4. Limb Bones
**Arms (Forelimbs):**
- Have hands with fingers at the ends
- **Upper arm**: Single bone called **humerus**
- **Lower arm**: Two bones
- Help us **write and pick things up**

**Legs (Hindlimbs):**
- Have feet with toes at the ends
- **Upper leg**: **Thigh bone (femur)** - longest bone in body
- **Lower leg**: Two bones
- Help us **run, walk, and stand**

#### 5. Girdles
**Structure:**
- Group of bones that connect limbs to central body
- **Shoulder girdle**: Connects arms to body
- **Hip girdle**: Connects legs to body

**Functions:**
- Give **support to limbs**
- Help in **different movements**

### Joints
A **joint** is a place where two or more bones are connected. Bones are held together by special tissues called **ligaments**.

#### Types of Joints

**Fixed Joints:**
- Bones are **rigidly connected**
- **Do not allow movement**
- Example: Most joints in skull

**Movable Joints:**
- Bones **can move** with respect to each other
- Allow movements like **walking, running, dancing**

#### Types of Movable Joints

**Ball-and-Socket Joint:**
- One bone shaped like ball, other like cup
- **Maximum movement** in all directions
- Examples: **Shoulder and hip joints**

**Hinge Joint:**
- One bone rounded like cylinder, other like hollow half-cylinder
- **Back-and-forth movement**
- Examples: **Elbow and knee joints**

**Pivot Joint:**
- One bone rotates freely inside ring of another bone
- **Up, down, and side-to-side movement**
- Example: **Skull joined to backbone**

**Gliding Joint:**
- Two flat bones glide over each other
- **Smooth movement** in any direction
- Examples: **Wrist and ankle joints**

### Functions of Skeletal System
1. **Protects internal organs** (heart, lungs, brain, spinal cord)
2. **Gives shape and support** to our body
3. **Helps in movement** through joints

### Amazing Facts About Bones
- **Newborn baby**: 300 bones
- **Adult human**: 206 bones (some bones join together as we grow)

## Muscular System

### What is the Muscular System?
Bones cannot move on their own - they need help from **muscles**! Muscles are attached to bones by strong structures called **tendons**. The human body has about **650 muscles**.

### Types of Muscles

#### Voluntary Muscles
- Muscles that are **under our control**
- We can move them when we want to
- **Skeletal muscles** are voluntary muscles
- Found in **arms and legs**
- Help in movements like **walking, running, playing**

#### Involuntary Muscles
- Muscles whose movement is **not under our control**
- Work automatically without us thinking

**Cardiac Muscles:**
- Found in the **heart**
- Help **pump blood** throughout body
- Work **continuously without getting tired**

**Smooth Muscles:**
- Found in **internal organs** like stomach, intestines, blood vessels
- Help **food pass through digestive system**
- Help in other automatic body functions

### Functions of Muscular System
1. **Works with skeletal system** for movement
2. **Pumps blood** through cardiac muscles
3. **Moves food** through digestive system
4. **Produces heat** when we shiver to keep us warm

### How Muscles Work
All muscles work by **contracting** (getting shorter) and then **relaxing** (returning to original size).

**Example - Picking up a book:**
1. **Extend arm**: Muscle 1 contracts, Muscle 2 relaxes
2. **Bend arm**: Muscle 1 relaxes, Muscle 2 contracts

## Connection Between Skeletal and Muscular Systems
These two systems work together like a perfect team:
- **Bones** provide structure and support
- **Joints** allow movement
- **Muscles** provide the power to move bones
- **Tendons** connect muscles to bones

## Key Terms to Remember
- **Framework**: Basic structure that provides shape
- **Vertebrae**: Small bones that make up the backbone
- **Ligaments**: Special tissues that hold bones together at joints
- **Tendons**: Strong structures that attach muscles to bones
- **Contracting**: Muscles getting shorter
- **Rigidly**: In a stiff way
- **Cavity**: Empty space within an object

## Study Tips
1. Remember that skeletal system has 5 main parts: skull, backbone, ribcage, limb bones, girdles
2. Know the 4 types of movable joints and their examples
3. Understand the difference between voluntary and involuntary muscles
4. Remember that muscles work in pairs - one contracts while other relaxes
5. Practice identifying bones you can feel in your own body

## Fun Facts
- The femur (thigh bone) is the longest and strongest bone in your body
- Your heart muscle beats about 100,000 times per day!
- Muscles make up about 40% of your total body weight
- The smallest muscle in your body is in your ear
- When you smile, you use 17 muscles, but when you frown, you use 43 muscles!
