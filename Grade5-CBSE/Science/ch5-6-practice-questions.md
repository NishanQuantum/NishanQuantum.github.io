## Section B: Give Reasons (15 marks)
**Instructions:** Give scientific reasons for the following statements. (3 marks each)

1. Why do we pull our hand away immediately when we touch a hot object?

2. Why is the cerebellum important for activities like cycling and dancing?

3. Why can't we control our heartbeat even though it involves muscle movement?

## Section C: Application-Based Questions (20 marks)
**Instructions:** Apply your knowledge to solve these real-life situations. (4 marks each)

1. Ravi was playing cricket when the ball came straight toward his face. Without thinking, he immediately raised his hands to protect his face. Explain what type of action this was and describe the pathway of this response through his nervous system.

2. Priya's grandmother has difficulty moving her knee joint. The doctor says her joint has become stiff due to age. Explain which type of joint is present at the knee and why this joint is important for walking.

3. During a science experiment, students were asked to identify different tastes while blindfolded. They could still identify sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes. Explain how this was possible and which parts of the nervous system were involved.

4. Amit noticed that when he exercises, his breathing becomes faster and his heart beats quicker, but he doesn't have to think about making these changes happen. Explain why these changes occur automatically.

5. A doctor examining a patient's X-ray noticed that two bones in the patient's arm were not properly connected after a fracture. Explain why this would affect the patient's ability to move their arm.

## Section D: What If Case Questions (15 marks)
**Instructions:** Think critically and answer these hypothetical situations. (3 marks each)

1. What if humans didn't have reflex actions? How would this affect our daily life and safety?

2. What if our bones were made of a soft material like rubber instead of being hard? How would this change our abilities?

3. What if we only had voluntary muscles and no involuntary muscles? What problems would we face?

4. What if our joints were all fixed joints like those in the skull? How would our life be different?

5. What if humans had only sensory nerves but no motor nerves? What would happen to our body functions?

## Section E: Long Answer Questions (Think and Answer Type) (30 marks)
**Instructions:** Answer the following questions in detail. (6 marks each)

1. **Describe the complete structure and functions of the human brain.** Include all three parts of the brain, their specific functions, and explain how they work together to control our body.

2. **Explain how the five sense organs work together with the nervous system to help us interact with our environment.** Give examples of how each sense organ collects information and sends it to the brain.

3. **Compare and contrast the skeletal system and muscular system.** Explain how these two systems work together to help us move. Include examples of their cooperation in at least two different body movements.

4. **Describe the different types of joints in the human body.** Explain the structure and function of each type with specific examples. Why are different types of joints necessary for different movements?

5. **Explain the pathway of a voluntary action from start to finish.** Choose any voluntary action (like writing your name) and trace the complete pathway from the brain to the muscles, explaining the role of different parts of the nervous system.
